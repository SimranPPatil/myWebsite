								<h2>Bon Voyage!</h2>
									<p class="data">The bags have been placed in the trunk of my car. I have a ton of paraphernalia set well in my backpack. Passport, Check. Tickets, Check. Prayers have been made. The wardrobe has been locked and I give a final glimpse to my room prior to my departure. I am an explorer and I love to travel but this time it isn’t a carefree vacation that I am heading forward to. I am leaving for University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign today. This is probably one of the most adventurous endeavors that I have undertaken so far as I have never been away from my dear kith and kin. Yes, there has been a lot of emotional drama prior to my departure. My parents are travelling with me but I have a plethora of conflicting thoughts in my head. Baker and Syrik (1989) defined college adjustment as wellness in relation to a student’s academic, social, and emotional stability, as well as institutional attachment. Their model is a composition of four dimensions as follows. Academic adjustment addresses the degree to which a student has adapted to the academic demands that college presents. Social adjustment refers to the extent
	of a student’s integration into the college social community. Personal-emotional adjustment reflects the amount of psychological and physical distress that a student experiences in response to the demands of college. Institutional attachment refers to a student’s level of emotional connection with his or her academic institution. (Lapoint).</p>
									<p class="data">
									I am bogged up with questions in my head. How am I going to adjust to a nation so different with a culture juxtaposing against mine? How will I manage everything on my own? Will I be able to do justice to this independence? How efficient an engineer would I be? Is this the right decision?  But amidst all the eleventh hour thoughts, there was a ray of optimism and a strength that boosted my confidence. It takes courage to acknowledge what you feel-especially when it’s at odds with whatever your thoughts may be trying to rationalize. But this is the juncture where emotional literacy is born: in learning to remain aware of your thoughts while acknowledging the inner voice of your feelings. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” (Cooper 5). </p>
									<p class="data">
									I had to be stalwart and use this opportunity as my ammunition to win over my weaknesses, my extreme emotional fervor and to get ready for the outer world.  I love travelling and I have seen scenic destinations but exploring the world with responsibilities on my shoulder and independence at my disposal is a different deal altogether. I have to do justice to this newly procured freedom and not get bogged up by it like it were a sword of Damocles hanging from my head but an opportunity to set things right and make my parents proud, beyond it, become a stronger and a wiser person. Servabo Fidem.

								Geography lessons back in school were amongst my most disliked ones and the consequences of hating the subject eventually started showing up. This was my first time in the United States of America and the idea of being in the Prairies-The breadbasket of the World- as my blurred memories flashed by, fascinated me. What a feeling of delight to be in one of the most talked of places in Geography classes! But well, I remembered the phrases but paid no heed to the elephantine dimensions and the extreme climate. Humor found its way when a person who loved the sea ended up in a beautifully warm landlocked place. The sun kissed scenery pleased me but the heat drenched me. “The world turns on our every action, and our every omission, whether we know it or not.” (Verghese)

								 On the first day of instruction, I woke up enthralled with a boost of excitement. “Conventional wisdom for effectively teaching college courses suggests that the initial class sessions are critical for establishing an effective learning environment.” (Foster 111). It all seemed fine until the moment I set out of my room. Nothing comes easy but this surely left me in a state of despair. I wasn’t aware of the routes and the bus system. Leaving my place well in time, I happened to look up the ECE Building on Google Maps and set out in search of the place. The clocked ticked by but I seemed to keep walking and couldn’t find the place. Within no time I was in tears and I called up parents back in Florida at my Aunt’s place. Poor they! They freaked out because of my endless crying and panicking. Mollified, I continued to walk and reached my first class of ECE 110 and my first lecture on campus 20 minutes late. It was disappointing and I then realized that dimensions are never to be taken for granted. US is a big place indeed and there are patches of solitary vastness too. The very organization and stretch of the place demands vehicular transportation and the awareness of maps. I resorted to studying roads and I surely should thank Google for their amazing satellite coverage because had it not been for Google and its services, I probably would have been a lonely lost wanderer with a ceaseless supply of salted water from my lachrymal glands. Eventually the day passed well. I realized that time and distance were to be conquered for survival sake. Nevertheless, College life had its wonders unfold before me with time. I got lost on this gigantic labyrinth like campus multiple times and that made me fall in love more with this place that I call home now. I take pride in being a part of this place and certainly , there are fallouts in taking up the wrong route when in a time-crunch but Life here has taught me one thing- Survival Instincts- Lose you way and find a way out while enjoying the beauty that the campus offers. It’s breathtakingly enchanting. I am bewitched and probably would always be. The campus community coaches you to be a performer, a survivor and of course, a proficiency in your major. Oskee-wow-wow!

								This was the one day that I had fantasized about all my life. I turned 18 today and as a kid I always looked forward to this day. Cars have always fascinated me and back in India, 18 is the legal age to learn and start driving and hence, I had an ardent desire to get before the steering wheel on the very day I would turn 18.  “Life doesn’t always go according to the plan. Sometimes heading in a new direction can be scary until you realize you are headed towards a new and exciting destination.” (Susan Gale). So there I was on the other side of the globe, in a setting I had never thought of being in, which I now gracefully accept as mine. Reminiscing the old days, I could very well state what driving meant to me. It meant a sense of independence in leading one’s life in a city like Mumbai which is known for its bustle and traffic; it meant being part of the fabric that embraces the city; it meant easing out of the worries; it meant a solitary space to seek solace out of the atrocities of the work place. It was a way of life for a few, a necessity for some and subsistence for the others. It meant pure fascination for me. It signified adulthood which amazed me as a kid. Two themes dominate the recent flow of literature on the relation between driver and car. Either the car is seen as an extension of the human body, reinforcing human capacities, or it is seen as a room, a more or less private space to inhabit (Hagman). Nevertheless, I surely couldn’t do that this day but life had its own surprises to replace the unplanned plans that I had once drawn.

I was amongst my first set of midterms in my first semester of college. The fact that it was all first raised its importance in my eyes. My recollections of the first month in college are purely of work and accommodation. I would simply keep working on my assignments for a major chunk of my time. I recollect interactions with my roommate and a few friends that I had made and being termed as a workaholic by those who knew me. I was too worked up to be a perfectionist but that invited a tradeoff which I didn’t see coming. "Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself." (Rowling).  I had lost the belief in myself. “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” (Rowling). And probably God set his angels to me to give my life a novel twist. On my birthday I got along with a set of people all from distinct backgrounds but who now are my closest friends on campus and we call ourselves ‘ The Family ‘ . Little did I know that a small time with my once acquaintances can eventually be etched down into one of the most memorable and timeless moments of my life. My friends here made my eighteenth birthday worthwhile. I practice abstinence from alcohol and things alike so without a doubt, that wasn’t my thing and neither was theirs. We had a sweet and small celebration in the dining hall wherein we cut a nice warm, chocolate cake and had a hearty meal with a bubbling conversation over it. I then requested them to take me to the Alma Mater as I always wanted to take a picture there. But then came the fun part in the story, they all climbed up and made me do so too- a setting for a crazy picture and a memorable one- as they put it before me. I being a coward expressed resistance and but they convinced me to climb up and we had a perfectly photographic picture. These people have made life in college worthwhile. Amidst all the work and craziness, it with their craziness that treading through even the greyest of days and the most tortuous of ways seems like child’s play. They helped me believe in myself and taught me the importance of having people and enjoying work rather than mechanically working. Many university friendships last a lifetime. The bonding that occurs is so strong that those ties survive marriage, children, job changes and long distance. I think it happens when the people involved actually "found themselves" while at school. They settled into a skin that suited them and chose friends who suited that personality, the one they keep for a lifetime (Cameron). Probably that’s why at the end of the day, I have more stories to tell and memories to reflect back on then work that would just help me through my major. Being with The Family is a way of life for me now and meeting them was probably the best gift I could have got on my eighteenth birthday.

								<h2>Introspection!</h2>
								<p class="data">
								The semester is coming to an end. And so is this year. Now that I reflect back on how the year transitioned as I warped through time, and if I am not being anachronistic about the events, it was surely amongst the most important and significant years of my life.  Coming to UIUC, being exposed to such a diverse and challenging curriculum, exploring the scope of my major, touring across Chicago with my friends, spending thanksgiving with my roommate in a typical American household, getting exposed to the new culture, learning about the superpower, exploring responsibility and friendship, living through separation from dear ones and growing stronger rather than giving up- all reflecting back on the past and preparing for a better tomorrow, positively, it was a significant year. The semester has been pretty smooth so far. Today is my chemistry exam and I feel I am prepared for it. It is 3 am in the morning. I am done with my studies and am resting in bed with my friend. She has the exam along with me at 8 am in the morning. More than the test, I was worried about waking up the reason why we both decided to be together. The habit of sleeping late every night had grown so disastrously bad that we couldn’t sleep until it was 5am in the morning. 2 hours of sleep and we left for breakfast and the exam. But today when I look back, I don’t judge how non-salubrious it is to have an erratic sleeping pattern, but I remember the good old memories. 'It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.' (Doyle).College has introduced a crazy novelty altogether. It has made me much more responsible and independent but has taught a way to enjoy work and life to the fullest as well. “Real education is that which enables one to stand on one’s own legs”.  Education prepares a man for social service, to develop his character and finally infuses him with the spirit and courage of a lion. For getting degree is not an education, the proper education must be viewed on the basis of character, mental powers, intelligence and inculcates, self-confidence and self-reliance in the individuals.” (Tripathi). Education isn’t only about the theories that have triggered through the books. Education is the training of a man for a better lifestyle. While life and nature sing a melodious tone in harmony, adversities follow too. Education is an integral part of growing up and dealing with such adversities. “Adversity builds character” (Cooper 119). College is a perfect platform for growth as it caters to every facet of human life in subtle ways.

									“The best thing for being sad," replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, "is to learn something. That's the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, and you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then — to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn.” <br>

								Life transitioned ahead into the second semester of college life after a great first semester and a memorable winter back home. Meeting my family back home was refreshing indeed. It was time to make this semester challenging and thus as a testimony to my ardent desires, I accepted the assistantship offers and the research opportunities put before me. This indeed was a challenge for myself as my dad had always annotated on my teaching skills. While working on helping my younger sister with her homework, I would always lose patience and either give up on her or scold her. Teaching isn’t child’s play indeed. It is probably one of the toughest skills one can master. In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn. (Collins). This was a challenge for me and I accepted it. The challenge toughed up when my teacher introduced a new approach towards teaching. It involved teaching the students by involving them through interactions and interrogations. A wise man once said – “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.” Benjamin Franklin’s famous quote has since been proven by science; educators now call it “experiential learning.” (Angelo). I think I am getting along the flow well. There are so many new things that I am learning in the process of teaching it to the present students. This a great thing to achieve as apart from working on my teaching skills, I am getting more proficient at my subjects. Having an on-campus job was a completely new experience as I had never worked before this. The system in India is such that kids do not tend to work until they are done with the undergraduate studies. It is fascinating to know that the society in the Unites States of America focuses more on self-sustenance and independence in the sense that children get to work after highschool. After starting work, I myself feel independent and responsible.

	Managing the course workload with the jobs is getting tougher with the passage of time. Time Management is a vital skill that my college experience is helping me master. Time management is seen as a coping strategy to deal with stressors and decrease feelings of stress ( Häfner). The education system is such that only good grades wouldn’t help us get a placement in the competitive job market. The extracurricular activities that we are a part of play a significant role in our holistic development as well as getting us closer to procuring good jobs in the market. The courses are demanding and the workload is heavy. Managing sleep and a social life becomes difficult as we grow more responsible. But that is the best part about college life. You have to strive tio achieve things and give the best of you for everything you do. It is fascinating to know how this divine feeling of satisfaction gobbles you after performing a job well. May be that’s the best part about college life; it might be extremely tedious and would make you work from the sweat of your brow. But in the end, it’ll seem all worthwhile. There is joy in the struggle. There is peace after the job. There is reward for every action. I am glad that I am in college now. I am glad to be a true Illini. I am true to the Alma Mater. And I am going to make these days the most reminiscent days of my life. </p>

								<h2>Airport Diaries (In Progress)</h2>
								<p class="data">
								Life is a beautiful journey, a breath-taking adventure in all its totality and a venture that embraces a wall of enigma around it. It is in moments of solitude that our minds steer towards an uncharted road, sinking into profound reflections which might be absorbed as reasoning by a few and contemplation by the others. Simple as it might seem, everything comes at a price that we pay with a subtle comprise from time to time.</p>

	You must be wondering why I am forcing you into this weird introspection. Well, I believe that a plot requires one to build up to the climax but I am going to set track for you with this anticlimactic assertion. As I quoted above, you traverse the depths of human understanding when you have time to kill and here I am, indulging in this dialogue with your minds, bundled up to let the clock tick by a bit faster in my frame. It’s all about relativity. 
	Context is what makes up the ethos of understanding a piece. Data fed into a system can only sink in with crystalline clarity if the context and scenario are put forth with intricate detail. Let’s walk you through my journey.</p>
	<p class="data">
	I am currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pursuing Computer Engineering. I hail from Mumbai- a city that never sleeps- the city of dreams and my heartthrob. Coming to a place amidst the breadbasket of the world and being the first in my family to do so has been an honor for me. I think that my bucket of positive karma sparkled some charm on my fate to bless me with this. UIUC is my home now and learning and working here is a religious ethic. </p>
	<p class="data">
	When you move to a new place, you don’t just change your geographic location. You change your little world. It is like escaping from the fragile boundaries of your protective shell. It is like wandering into the magnanimity to explore the then unknown, to familiarize it to an extent where you can call it your native, your own. It is an amalgamation of emotional and intellectual puzzle pieces segmenting and merging to frame your new masterpiece. With it, you get introduced to the numerous faces of Mother Earth. Her frosty blanket, her tempestuous turmoil, her loving blossoms and her scorching rage. Mumbai experiences a consistent flavor of Earth’s personality. Illinois on the other hand is bestowed with it - all appended in a series to fit a 24-hour time frame. Landlocked as it is, it also embraces the extremes. It is then that every day marks a new surprise and knocks gently at your corpus callosum to merge the old with the new. This is how to keep track of the new. This is how you mold yourself to make this novelty your reality. As a student, you enter a new stage of life. You are pumped up to chase your dreams and grow into proficient humans. It is a training session that you love. It is something that makes you fall in love with your work. It justifies your passion and channelizes ambition.
